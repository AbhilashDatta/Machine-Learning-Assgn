# Machine-Learning-Assgn
Assignments for the Machine Learning course at IIT KGP

`All codes are written from scratch. No machine learning library used`

### ASSIGNMENT 1 (Linear Regression)
Perform Linear Regression on a synthetically generated dataset using Gradient Descent. Use of various hypothesis function, cost function and learning rates.
Plots for curve fitting using various hypothesis functions and learning curves are attatched.


### ASSIGNMENT 2 (Decision Tree)
Perform classification using Decision Tree on a toy dataset as well as on a simplified version of "20newsgroup" dataset. Build the tree using Gini Index as well as Information Gain as the attribute-selection criterion.
Comparison of the algorithm with sklearn is shown in the assignment.
